# Mosquitto MQTT broker Docker image

This image places the Mosquitto MQTT broker (https://mosquitto.org/) in a Docker container and pre-configures it for use in my Home Assistant setup. It may be useful to others, and may need changes to suit your needs.

It is however quite generic and could be used for any purpose.

It provides 3 external ports for incoming connections but otherwise its configuration is currently quite simple.

This container does not currently implement ACLs (Access Control Lists) or any other advanced functionality. Feel free to make pull requests and/or raise issues for changes.

It is configured with three listening ports, one with TLS for external use, two without; one for LAN and one for LOCAL. The LOCAL port is configured in the docker-compose to listen only on 1270.0.1.

## Ports

### WAN
Port `2883` is configured for WAN access, this port must be supplied with a CA certificate and a server certificate and key.

The WAN port will listen using TLS given the certificates you provide and can be forwarded through your external router in order to access it from outside your network.

This port is useful for reporting location back from Owntracks on your mobile device to be used in Home Assistant to determine if/when you are home.

> NOTE: It is important that you add users to your mosquitto credentials file using the instructions below AND __restart the server__. If you do not perform both of these actions, it can be accessed anonymously.

### LAN
Port `1883` is configured to LAN access, this port does not use TLS.

The LAN port will listen on all interfaces of the host machine according to the compose file, feel free to change this if you wish to bind a specific address.i

This port is useful for connecting from Home Assistant if it's running on another machine on your network.

### LOCAL
Port `3883` is configured for LOCAL access, this port does not use TLS.

The LOCAL port will listen on 127.0.0.1 of the host machine according to the compose file. It is to be used when connecting from other services on the same machine.

If your other services are running in Docker, however, I would recommend disabling this port and connecting directly on a Docker bridge/private network.

This port is useful for connecting from Home Assistant if it's on this machine but not in Docker, or for other software on this machine. For services inside Docker, follow the suggestion above and disable this port for security.

## Access Control
The container is configured to disallow anonymous access on all ports, but, this will be the case only after you add users. It seems that while the password file is empty, anyone can connect. It may choose to add a randomly generated user to it in the future to prevent people accidently leaving it open. In this case, you will not be able to connect until you add a user yourself.

## Adding users
Once the container is configured correctly with certificates and it starts successfully, you can add users. Run the following command to add a user interactively.

```
docker-compose exec mqtt adduser <username> 
```
you will be prompted for a password, and then to repeat it.

## Deleting users

```
docker-compose exec mqtt deluser <username>
```

## Configuring Home Assistant
You can configure Home Assistant as a client for this broker, it will allow to gather published topics.

If you also configure Home Assistant for Owntracks, Home Assistant will pick up location changes for Owntracks users through this broker.

### configuration.yml

An example configuration looks as follows, you tell Home Assistant where to look for the broker, this is the address of the machine this Docker container runs on and has bound the port to. 

`client_id` helps the broker identify this "client" in it's logs etc. Most importantly, the username and password should be set to the ones you generated in the steps above.

If you decide to use TLS for this connection, you can provide your CA for Home Assistant to make the connection. This is only needed if you're using self-signed certificates.

```
mqtt:
  broker: <ip of the host machine where this is hosted>
  port: 1883
  client_id: home-assistant
  keepalive: 60
  username: homeassistant
  password: <password created using instructions above>
#  certificate: /home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/ca.crt (for example)
```

### Subscribing to topics

I have a Homie MQTT sensor I built using an ESP8266 sitting in my server rack, this publishes the temperature inside the rack periodically to this broker.

Home Assistant can be configured to "subscribe" that topic, and therefore access the temperature as a sensor.

```
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: 'homie/<device-identifier>/temperature/temperature'
    name: 'Rack'
    unit_of_measurement: 'Â°C'
```

When the temperature sensor publishes to the topic above, Home Assistant will be subscriber and receive and update of the temperature, this can then be displayed as any other sensor in Home Assistant.

Another example, my PC publishes its presence so Home Assistant can control my desk lamp when the PC is on/off.

```
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: 'presence/office/desktop/online'
    name: Desktop
```

The desktop uses startup/shutdown scripts to publish its presence using the `mosquitto_pub` tool in Linux;
```
mosquitto_pub -d -V mqttv311 -u desktopuser -P "<desktoppassword>" -h <broker ip address> -i cmdLinePub -t "presence/office/desktop/online" -m "ON"

```
And when it turns off:
```
mosquitto_pub -d -V mqttv311 -u desktopuser -P "<desktoppassword>" -h <broker ip address> -i cmdLinePub -t "presence/office/desktop/online" -m "OFF"
```

> NOTE Don't forget to register these users in moqsuitto

> TIP: If you use the external address like Owntracks, you can use this same mechanism to control Home Assistant and/or alert it if your laptop is turned on/off even when you're away from home, e.g. when you're at work.
